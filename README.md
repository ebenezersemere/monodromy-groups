### Abstract
An elliptic curve $E: y^2 + a_1 x y + a_3 y = x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_6$ is a cubic equation which has two curious properties: (1) the curve is nonsingular, so that we can draw tangent lines to every point $P = (x,y)$ on the curve; and (2) the collection of complex points, namely $E(\mathbb C)$, forms an abelian group under a certain binary operation $\bigoplus: E(\mathbb C) \times E(\mathbb C) \to E(\mathbb C)$.   In particular, for every positive integer $N$, the map $P \mapsto [N] P$ which adds a point $P \in E(\mathbb C)$ to itself $N$ times is a group homomorphism. A rational map $\gamma: \mathbb P^1(\mathbb C) \to \mathbb P^1(\mathbb C)$ from the Riemann Sphere to itself is said to be a Lattès Map if there are "well-behaved" maps $\phi: E(\mathbb C) \to \mathbb P^1(\mathbb C)$ and $\psi: E(\mathbb C) \to E(\mathbb C)$ such that $\gamma \circ \phi = \phi \circ \psi$.  We are interested in those Lattès Maps $\gamma$ which are also Belyi Maps, that is, the only critical values are $0$, $1$, and $\infty$.  Work of Zeytin classifies all such maps: For example, if $E: y^2 = x^3 + 1$ then $\phi: (x,y) \mapsto (y+1)/2$ while $\psi = [N]$ for some positive integer $N$.  In this project, we are interested in the corresponding Belyi Lattes Map $\gamma$.  What can we say about such maps?  What are their Dessin d'Enfants?  Preliminary work shows that this should be a bipartite graph with $3N^2$ vertices.  What are their monodromy groups? Preliminary work shows this should be a group of size $3N^2$.  This is work done as part of the Pomona Research in Mathematics Experience (DMS-2113782).
